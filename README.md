# 🚀 Vedant's Garage

Welcome to my hub of experiments, breakthroughs, and learnings as I explore the frontiers of computer science and software engineering.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Vedant**, a Computer Science undergrad with an insatiable curiosity for solving real-world problems using tech. My work revolves around:

- 🧠 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics**
- 🧰 **Automation Tools & Simulators**
- 🛠️ **System-Level Programming**
- 🎨 **Human-Centered Interfaces & AI Agents**

I'm passionate about building tools that are not only functional but also visually and interactively engaging – blending logic with aesthetics.

## 🔍 Current Focus

I'm currently working on:

- 🤖 **Face Recognition System** – Real-time recognition with interactive commendations & visual feedback.
- 🔐 **Cyber Triage Toolkit** – For the Anti-Cyber Terrorism Division, built with speed, clarity, and field usability in mind.
- 🧠 **LLM Playground** – Exploring transformer models with Hugging Face, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to move from Software 1.0 to 3.0.

## 🧪 Core Philosophy

> _"If you're going to build it, make it intelligent. be it beautiful. And so be it yours."_  
- I like systems that **feel alive**, **react fast**, and **tell a story**.
